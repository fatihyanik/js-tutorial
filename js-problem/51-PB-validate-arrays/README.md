# Validate arrays

Please print each of your answers to the console.

**. The Task🚀.**
Create a function that accepts array of numbers as argument and returns an valid array of numbers (without repeating exciting elements). 
The function should WORK dynamically.


* Examples:
```
INPUT [5,3,22,4,5,3,3,3,7] ==> Function🤖 ==> OUTPUT [5,3,22,4,7]
INPUT [1,2,3,2,3,5,3,6,3,1] ==> Function🤖 ==> OUTPUT [1,2,3,5,6]
INPUT [2,6,7,2,4,2,7,2] ==> Function🤖 ==> OUTPUT [2,6,7,4]
```

🚀 Good Luck 🚀
