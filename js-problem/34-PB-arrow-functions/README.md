# 34-PB-arrow-functions

## Complete the following tasks using arrow functions.

#### 1. Multiply

Multiply two numbers and return the result using an arrow function.

#### 2. Double The Odds

Given any array of numbers e.g. [3, 5, 67, 12, 34, 4, 9, 30], filter the odd numbers into a new array and multiply each odd number by 2.

#### 3. Loopyloop

Given an array of numbers, loop through the array and subract 10 from each element using an arrow function. Return the new array.

#### 4. Filter

Given this array: [3,62,234,7,23,74,23,76,92], use the array filter method and an arrow function to create an array of the numbers greater than `70`. Store the result into a variable.

#### 5. Geometrizer

Create two functions that calculate the properties of a circle.

Create a function called calcCircumfrence:

- Pass the radius to the function.
- Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN".

Create a function called calcArea:

- Pass the radius to the function.
- Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN".
