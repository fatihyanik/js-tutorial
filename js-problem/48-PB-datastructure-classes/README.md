# Classy

#### 1. Person Class

- Create a class called `Person` which accepts the name of a person as a string, and his/her age as a number. The `Person` class should have a method called describe which returns a string with the following syntax: "name, age years old". So, for example, if John is 19 years old, then the function describe of his object will return "John, 19 years old".

#### 2. Volume

- Write a JavaScript program to get the volume of a cylinder with four decimal places using a class.

- **Note**: Volume of a cylinder : `V = πr^2h` - r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.

#### 3. Tick Tock

Rewrite the following code to use the "class" syntax.

```javascript
function Clock({ template }) {
  let timer;

  function render() {
    let date = new Date();

    let hours = date.getHours();
    if (hours < 10) hours = "0" + hours;

    let mins = date.getMinutes();
    if (mins < 10) mins = "0" + mins;

    let secs = date.getSeconds();
    if (secs < 10) secs = "0" + secs;

    let output = template
      .replace("h", hours)
      .replace("m", mins)
      .replace("s", secs);

    console.log(output);
  }

  this.stop = function () {
    clearInterval(timer);
  };

  this.start = function () {
    render();
    timer = setInterval(render, 1000);
  };
}

let clock = new Clock({ template: "h:m:s" });
clock.start();
```

#### 4. TV Class

- Create a TV class with properties like brand, channel and volume.
- Specify brand in a constructor parameter. Channel should be 1 by default. Volume should be 50 by default.
- Add methods to increase and decrease volume. Volume can't never be below 0 or above 100.
- Add a method to set the channel randomly. Let's say the TV has only 50 channels.
- Add a method to reset TV so it goes back to channel 1 and volume 50.
- It's useful to write a status, that returns info about the TV status like: "Panasonic at channel 8, volume 75".
